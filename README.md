# Attack-Flows

While individual cyber attacks are widely documented, complete steps of attack models are extremely scarce. This is problematic, as it leaves future systems vulnerable to the same attack patterns. This exploration aims to locate, model, and explain successful real-world attacks, and contribute directly to the MITRE database. The aim is to decrease the success rate of similar future attacks.
